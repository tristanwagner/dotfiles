dotfiles
===================

Forked from [mcscoutermarsh's dotfiles](https://github.com/mscoutermarsh/dotfiles)

## New to Vim?
+ [Learning Vim in a Week](https://mikecoutermarsh.com/boston-vim-learning-vim-in-a-week/)
+ [Upcase: The Art of Vim](https://upcase.com/vim) 

If you're brand new to Vim, I recommend using [ThoughtBot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles). They are better maintained than mine :).
